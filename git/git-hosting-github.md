## Git repository hosting

Several services allow the creation of *shared repositories on the cloud*.
They *enrich* the base git model with services built around the tool:

* **Forks**: copies of a repository associated to different users/organizations
* **Pull requests** (or **Merge requests**): formal requests to *pull* updates from *forks*
  * repositories do not allow pushes from everybody
  * what if we want to contribute to a project we cannot push to?
    * *fork* the repository (we *own* that copy)
    * write the contribution and push to our *fork*
    * ask the maintainers of the *original repository* to *pull from* our fork
* **Issue tracking**

## Most common services

* **GitHub**
  * Replaced Sourceforge as the *de-facto standard* for open source projects hosting
  * *Academic plan*
* **GitLab**
  * Available for free as *self-hosted*
  * Userbase grew when Microsoft acquired GitHub
* **Bitbucket**
  * From Atlassian
  * Well integrated with other products (e.g., Jira)
